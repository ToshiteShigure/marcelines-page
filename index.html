                    <h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Marceline Abadeer (full title: Marceline the Vampire Queen) is one of the main characters in
                        Adventure Time and the main protagonist of the miniseries Stakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Marceline is a fun-loving 1,000-year-old vampire queen. Unlike a traditional vampire, Marceline
                        does not need to drink blood to survive; rather, she eats the color red. Marceline is also an
                        avid musician who plays an electric bass that she made from her family's heirloom battle-axe.
                        She is currently in a romantic relationship with Princess Bubblegum, something revealed to the
                        audience during the episode «Come Along With Me».</p>

                    <h1>Personality</h1>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>I'm not mean. I'm a thousand years old, and I just lost track of my moral code.</p>
                            <p>— Marceline describing her personality in the «House Hunting Song» from «Evicted!»</p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </div>
                    <p>Having spent centuries traversing the Land of Ooo, she has evolved into a «fearless daredevil»,
                        and her fondness for mischief has turned her into something of a trickster. Consequently, in her
                        first role, Marceline functions as the antagonist of the story, forcing Finn and Jake from their
                        home. However, she eventually becomes their close friend once Finn recognizes that she is «a
                        radical dame who likes to play games».</p>
                    <p>It is implied that some of her more malevolent traits are solely based on her vampire instincts.
                        In «Red Starved», Marceline slowly becomes vicious and sinister after having been deprived of
                        food, trying to tempt Jake so that she could eat him. In «Vamps About», Marceline was fine with
                        Peppermint Butler creating weapons meant to kill her as a contingency, stating that she could
                        have snapped and killed everyone at any given time.
                    </p>
                    <p>She can also be sentimental. She was very emotionally attached to her teddy bear Hambo, which was
                        given to her by Simon Petrikov; after Ash sold it to Maja, she was furious and broke up with
                        him. Later, Princess Bubblegum got Hambo back in the episode «Sky Witch». However, she was
                        willing to give up Hambo in order to help Simon reconnect with his wife, Betty Grof.
                    </p>
                    <p>Marceline seems to be very emotional. For example, in «What Was Missing», she seemed to be more
                        aggressive towards Princess Bubblegum than she usually is. She is also very independent, and in
                        early episodes would often act without concern for Finn or his friends. It is easier for
                        Marceline to express her feelings through music, as seen in the «Fry Song» and «I'm Just Your
                        Problem,» but has trouble expressing them otherwise. She keeps a diary that she uses for
                        inspiration for songs as seen in «Marceline's Closet». When Marceline read the lyrics to
                        «Remember You», the song that Simon Petrikov wrote for her, she began to cry.
                    </p>
                    <p>Near the end of «The Dark Cloud», her personality changed slightly. Marceline had learned how to
                        be more mature which is proved by her saying that she will be able to hang out with Princess
                        Bubblegum «forever». She also said the learned how to be more empathetic to others too. Yet, it
                        is still unknown if she got over her emptiness in the end.</p>
